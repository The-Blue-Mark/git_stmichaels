              How does the referral process work?
            </div>
            <p>There are two options for getting referred to the St. Michael’s Obstetrics team. If you have a family doctor you can ask that they refer you to one of our Obstetricians.<br>
            <br>
            If you <i><u>do not</u></i> have a family doctor you can call our clinic and get instantly referred to one of our obstetricians.</p>

              At what point in my pregnancy journey should I consider speaking with my OBGYN?
            </div>
            <p>If you are considering a pregnancy or have recently become pregnant we recommend seeking the guidance of an obstetrician as a great first step. They’ll be able to walk you through what to expect, helpful pointers, and assess any risks
            based on your personal and family health history.</p>
            <p>Alternately, your family doctor may manage your early pregnancy visits, and then refer you to see an obstetrician at around 12 weeks.</p>

              Is it possible to get a tour of the facilities and meet the doctors I’ll be working with?

            <div class="faq-q underline">
              How often will I have to come in and visit?
            </div>
            <p>Pregnancy is measured in weeks. A normal pregnancy is about 40 weeks. Generally, the first visit takes place 12 weeks from your last period. You can come sooner if you have concerns.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>From 12-28 weeks, your visits are generally every 4 weeks.</li>
              <li>From 28-36 weeks, your visits are generally every 2 weeks.</li>
              <li>From 36 weeks until you deliver, your visits are weekly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to the frequency of visits at the tail end of the pregnancy it's important to consider your proximity to the hospital, and whether you’ll be able to complete all of your appointments in one location.</p>
